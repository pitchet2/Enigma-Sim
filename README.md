Instruction:
This simulation is to simulate the enigma machine. There are 3 parts for the simulation: 

1) Select Rotor: Selecting Rotor, Rotor 1,2,3 are from the right to the left in the picture. Each rotor has 8 options to choose from.
2) Initial Setting: Set the first letter for each rotor on the display. After Rotor 1 completes 1 revolution, Rotor 2 moves 1 letter. After Rotor2 completes 1 revolution, Rotor 3 moves 1 letter.
3) Plug Board: Plug board connects a pair of letter. If A connects to B, when A is clicked, the input to the rotor would be B. The Plug Board would automaticaly deletes repeated letters if there were any.
