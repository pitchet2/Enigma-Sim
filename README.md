THE ENIGMA ENIGMA: HOW THE ENIGMA MACHINE WORKED:

Instruction:
This simulation is to simulate the enigma machine. There are 3 parts for the simulation.


 ![GUI](https://github.com/pitchet2/Enigma-Sim/blob/master/GUI.PNG)

When a key on the keyboard is pressed, one or more rotors move to form a new encoding. The current flows from the key, through the PlugBoard, enters the rotor 1,2,3, then going back into the rotor 3,2,1 in a different path. The current then travels to the PlugBoard and generates the output letter. 

1) Select Rotor: Select rotor options from the drop down menu, Rotor 1,2,3 are from the right to the left in the picture. Each rotor has 8 options to choose from.

2) Initial Setting: Set the first letter for each rotor on the display from the drop down menu. There are 8 rotors for the machine to choose from, one for each of the 3 slots. Each rotor has its own letter mapping. Each time the key is pressed, the rightmost rotor rotates one place. After the rightmost rotor does a full revolution, the second rotor rotates once and so on. Much like the hands on the clock. 

3) PlugBoard: Connect two letters by pair, so if "A' is connected to 'B', 'A' becomes 'B' and 'B' becomes 'A'. They can be blank or up to 10 possible pairs.
